# Hi there, I'm Besher Alkurdi 👋

## About Me
I'm a Computer Science Graduate from Yildiz Technical University in Istanbul, Turkey, specializing in Natural Language Processing. I contributed to a TUBITAK-funded project, focusing on cutting-edge techniques in Curriculum Learning. Always excited to apply my knowledge and skills.

- 🔭 I’m currently wrapping up my research at Yildiz Technical University, where I've been involved in some fascinating AI research.
- 🌱 I’m continually learning and improving my skills. My latest interests are contrastive learning and more advanced aspects of deep learning.
- 🤝 I’m always open to collaborate on interesting projects, especially those involving Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback or Natural Language Processing.
- 🤔 If you have any challenging projects or concepts in these areas that you'd like to discuss, I'm all ears!
- 💬 Feel free to ask me about my research, and projects I've worked on. I'm always eager to share what I've learned and learn from others as well.
- 📫 How to reach me: You can send me an email at [mrbesheralkurdi@outlook.com](mailto:mrbesheralkurdi@outlook.com).
- ⚡ Fun fact: Apart from my love for tech and coding, I enjoy helping others learn. I've been a tutor at [Schoolhouse.world](https://schoolhouse.world) and some refugee focused institutions.
