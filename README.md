# Hi there, I'm Besher Alkurdi ðŸ‘‹

## About Me
Currently, I'm an NLP Researcher at Huawei Turkey R&D Center. I specialize in Natural Language Processing and have a background in Computer Science from Yildiz Technical University. I'm passionate about AI research and have contributed to a TUBITAK-funded project focusing on Curriculum Learning.

- ðŸ”­ At Huawei, I curate and synthesize data for fine-tuning large language models in multiple languages, leveraging model and data parallelism with mixed precision. I've also enhanced finetuning processes and created a versatile model serving platform.
- ðŸŒ± I'm continually learning and improving my skills, with recent interests in reinforcement learning and advanced aspects of efficient deep learning model finetuning and serving techniques.
- ðŸ’¬ Feel free to ask me about my research, projects, or my current role at Huawei. I'm always eager to share and learn.
